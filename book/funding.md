"[EAGER: CI PAOS: KnowLedger: An Open Digital Notebook for Research Data Management](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2437951)".

This project focuses on creation of an open ecosystem, KnowLedger, through developing a suite of components needed for 
an open digital research notebook (DRN) that will nominally serve all research communities, putting the control of the 
development in the hands of the research community (as far as possible), promoting data science/informatics as an 
important part of all research activities, and encouraging research data sharing and reuse. KnowLedger is envisioned 
to be a complete rethink of what a research notebook should be able to do, enabling new ways to record data/take notes, 
connect with online resources, and flexible so it can be tailored to the needs of the science and the scientific workflow.

Giving researchers the ability within KnowLedger to develop resources they need for RDM in an open and free ecosystem is
anticipated to encourage contribution to/participation in its development and garner suggestions for configuration 
options and functionality broadly. The ecosystem will be developed as an open and distributed model using GitHub 
repositories as hubs for community development of data access/data analysis modules, data templates (including minimum 
metadata standards), and research workflows. The goal is to outline an approach, setup several key resources, provide 
ideas of how the ecosystem could be setup, and enable the research community to; understand the idea, see the future of 
RDM, galvanize their disciplines into action, and leverage their discipline's available funding for community needs.
