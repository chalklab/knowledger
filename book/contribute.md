## Project Partner
Do you want to support this project by partnering with KnowLedger?  If so, please contact the PI (below) 
about how you would like to support the effort.

## Joining a Working Group
Working groups (WG) will be formed for each of the GitHub repositories in the ecosystem.  Just apply to be a collaborator 
on the repository supporting your interest and take part in meetings, sprints, and other WG activities.

## Contributing to the KnowLedger Codebase
Are you a Python developer?  If so, we could really use your expertise related to the KnowLedger Python codebase.  If
you more focused on web technology, MongoDB, Docker, backup system we also need your help too.  Read more about how you
can help on our project development repositories.

## Developing/Redeveloping Software/Tools for Ecosystem Integration
If you have developed software, built a research tool, or are a developer of a research repository or important data
resource admin, think about how your project might be integrated into the KnowLedger ecosystem.  Learn how to do this
my getting involved with the '[KnowMo](ecosystem.md#ecosystem-repositories)' working group as a module developer.

## Being an Advocate for KnowLedger in Your Community
This project will only succeed if research communities see the value in the development of KnowLedger for their
community.  As this project is only two years in duration, we need advocates for this project that will foster
interest, communicate developments in the project, and run/host meetings that can brainstorm what tooling, workflows,
and formats should be supported.  Champions across research disciplines will be co-ordinated through the 
'[KnowUs](ecosystem.md#ecosystem-repositories)' GitHub repository.

## Interested in Scientific Data Management Education?
As much as this project is focused on enabling research scientists being more productive and reproducible in research, 
the KnowLedger platform is an excellent place to excite and mentor the next generation of scientists.  Join the 
'[KnowHow](ecosystem.md#ecosystem-repositories)' WG as a developer of teaching material integrated into KnowLedger.

If you have other ideas about how you can contribute, please contact the PI!
