# Link Your Project to KnowLedger

We are interested in hearing about open-source tools, specifications, vocabularies etc. that can be integrated into the 
KnowLedger ecosystem.  These can be at any stage of development and usable in either the KnowLedger Python codebase, or
configurable as a modular component for use by researchers as part of their workflow.

This an important activity as the breath of research communities that might use KnowLedger is large and very difficult
for us to curate.  So, help us curate it by posting an issue to the KnowGrow GitHub repository.
