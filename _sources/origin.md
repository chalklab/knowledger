# Origin Story

You might be wondering where the name KnowLedger came from.  The PI wrote a grant three years ago
to NIST which ended up being a very small pilot of this idea, and the product was a Python/React app
built by an undergraduate student at the University of North Florida.  The name came from the idea
the that data recorded in KnowLedger would not only be stored in MongoDB, but it would also be added to 
a blockchain, the distributed **ledger** technology behind bitcoin.  This part of the project worked, but
it became clear that it was not well implemented and impractical as it was deployed.

The PI felt that this was not in scope for this current project but is optimistic that future funding
will allow this aspect of the KnowLedger ecosystem to make the collected data immutable.
