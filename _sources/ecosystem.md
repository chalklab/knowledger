# The KnowLedger Ecosystem

The KnowLedger concept is designed to be a high-level, open, and community driven infrastructure.  At the heart of the
project ecosystem is a set of GitHub repositories designed to allow open development of central features needed to make 
KnowLedger, modular, configurable, and extensible.

A visual representation of the project ecosystem is below, and more information on the development of KnowLedger can be 
found in the project proposal.

## Ecosystem Repositories
The ecosystem of GitHub repositories will focus on the following topic areas (this list will evolve/expand over time)
- KnowData - SciData framework for research data capture/data templates
- KnowAll - framework for (local) activity tracking (logging the amazing research you do)
- KnowShow - framework for data governance (defining how we look after our data)
- YouKnow - framework for user profiles (share your expertise across the ecosystem)
- KnowMo - framework for module development (enabling functionality in KnowLedger)
- KnowFlow - framework for workflow implementation (improving reproducibility)
- WeKnow - framework for collaboration (creating research communities)
- KnowHow - framework for education and training (teaching the future of science)
- KnowUs - framework for community engagement (outreach to understand your needs)
- KnowAble - framework for accessibility (making sure all are enabled in science)
- KnowGrow - collecting related software, tools, ontologies, specifications etc.

Are we missing something obvious?  Let us know what you think ;)
