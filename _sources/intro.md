This website describes the upcoming NSF funded project 
"[KnowLedger: An Open Digital Notebook for Research Data Management](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2437951)", 
a project to develop an open research notebook for the scientific community (2025-2026). The project was developed out
of a decade of research on the idea that an open, digital research notebook is needed across many communities.  Combined
with the movement toward open science, and the advent and interest in the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and 
Reusable) principles, technologically all the pieces of this complicated puzzle are now available.  The focus of this 
project then is to pull the all together into a single (but configurable) system.

Given the scope of this project it is important to that the project put researchers first, creating a system that allows
researchers to build an instance of KnowLedger that fits their needs, workflows, and requirements for data storage, 
security, and openness.  The project is thus based on the following observations of the research enteprise:
- Researchers need tailored solutions that fit their workflows and enable research progress rather than get in the way
- The cost of such solutions should be as cheap as possible and preferably free
- Any solution needs to ensure trust in the integrity of the stored data and make clear that a researcher (or the group 
  PI) has complete control of how, when and if data is made available to the community
- The research community must be integral to the development of any such RDM system, so they are vested in its success

The last point is especially important because the project team cannot anticipate what each researcher needs, so the
research community must be involved in the project and drive the tools, resources, data models, data format, that can be
used/written/accessed in the system.  The project therefore invites anyone in the research community to get involved so
the project knows what it needs to support at the system level.

More information about the KnowLedger implemention/development is available on left, as are opportunities where you can 
get involved, and how you can link your project to the KnowLedger project.

Get involved!
